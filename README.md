# Melbourne Airbnb Analysis

## Installations
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib
 - Sklearn

## Project Motivation
I wanted to understand the lanscape of Airbnb bookings but unfortunately were not able to find any relating to Malaysia. The closest region (which I also hope to visit soon) would be Melbourne and fortunately there is up to date open-sourced information in [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

I have targetted this analysis towards **Airbnb hosts**.

### Questions
- What is the lanscape of Airbnb listings in Melbourne?
- What factors influences the price of my stay?
- How can I improve my Airbnb listing to yield more customers?
- What are period on period trends? (YoY/MoM/DoD)
